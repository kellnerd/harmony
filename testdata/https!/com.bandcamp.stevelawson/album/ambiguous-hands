A 'hit record, see what comes out and what it says about how I feel' kind of recording. So it's big and spacey and ambient and full of promise and potential and a little melacholy. It takes its time and drifts from beauty to curiosity and back again. Epic amounts of relief and gratitude and light-headedness at finally, after ten years, being done with the PhD. Hopefully you've been able to find the dropbox link in the Bandcamp messages in order to read it if you so wish. If not, message me and I'll send it to you. Cos you're in it ;) \r\n\r\nThe title comes from how one amazing friend of mine refers to the 'praying hands' emoji, also possibly known as the high five emoji, or a bunch of other weird two-hands things, but almost universally used to represent gratitude/thanks/prayer/supplication... Nothing concrete, just an expression of good will and good wishes towards the universe. Ambiguous hands. x","credits":"Recorded at LawSound 3 on July 4th 2025\r\n\r\nAll the things, Steve.
